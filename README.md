Description
-------------
Our language enables the user to generate fractals in the Graphics Interchange Format, commonly abbreviated as GIF. Specifically, the user should be able to program a fractal using a type of formal grammar called an L-system.

We define L-system grammars as a tuple:
    L = (variables, init, rules),
where
- **variables**:  a set of symbols containing non-terminal elements
- **init**: a string of symbols from alphabet that defines the initial state of the system
- **rules**: a set of rules that defines the way variable can be replaced with combinations of constants and other variables. Constants are defined within the rules, and they are terminal.

Syntax
-------------
### Declaration/Assignment
Variables are declared and assigned in the same syntax as Java.
    int a;
    a = 0;
    int b = 1;
